# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Project
###### Worked on a data analysis project that used a dataset with several attributes to predict the onset of Parkinson's disease. 
###### In order to precisely predict the chance of Parkinson's disease, the data was analyzed, its dimensionality was decreased, and a machine learning model was constructed. carried out ETL, standardized the data, created a correlation matrix visualization, used PCA to reduce dimensionality, and put in place a Random Forest Regressor.
###### Attained a high model accuracy of 95.08%, indicating efficient model performance and data processing.
